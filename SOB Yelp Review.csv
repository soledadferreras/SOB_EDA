Regan C.,2020-12-18,"Provo, UT",5,"Went last night around 6, plenty of parking in the back. We got 6 different sliders to try and they were all delicious. Favorites were Buffalo and TX Philly. The lemon meringue shake was super good, very thick and creamy. Cheese curds also good, a little spicy and a ton of flavor. Will be back!",1,0,0,viernes,UT
Francisco M.,2020-12-18,"Parkdale, Dallas, TX",5,My boy Brian J. I think that's what his name was. Best attitude best customer service and the best suggestion.

Calme C.,2020-12-20,"San Francisco, CA",1,"The waffle fries and the Bergers are very tasty but The sizes are so tiny that I will not go back. The size is basically for a  three years old. I ordered for two adults and one child ( 3 sliders) , I thought I would have normal sizes portions. BUT NOT AT ALL!  I spent  more than $32 + $2 tips and  we sadly  left hungry . I had not ate  for the whole day so it was hard to swallow the bill and to leave the place starving..... It is so insulting in your soul when those situations happens. I went back home to eat and nourish my body,  myself.....!",0,8,2,domingo,CA
Lee A.,2020-12-20,"Plano, TX",5,"If you like great food that is a little off the norm, this will be your new fav. I had the PBJ slider, which was a great pairing of sweet and savory. Very yummy. The Popper slider was my friend's favorite.We paired sliders with the nacho fry. The waffle type fries are a good foundation for the amazing toppings piled on top.There are interesting flavors of sodas to enjoy, or beer and wine. My friend ordered the Pistachio Mint shake and we shared it for dessert. The shake was thick and rich with an amazing  flavor combination. It was a great ending to a unique and fun dining experience. This place is very new. It has fun decor celebrating meat! Don't worry though, there is actually a veggy option for those who prefer plant based burgers.The location has indoor dining which is very clean and observing social distancing. The patio has a fun atmosphere,  were you can eat and watch all the excitement on the street.The staff was very engaging and professional.  They made you feel welcome and they made sure that you had a great experience. For those who choose to grab and go, you can pre-order your food and pick it up at a drive up window.

Mary D.,2020-12-20,"Dallas, TX",5,"WOW. If you are looking for a laid-back spot to get a great meal, this is your place. We had a group of 7, so we ordered a large selection of sliders and a handful of beers. Every slider was well presented, and all were incredible. The owner stopped by our table and made sure to chat with us and thank us for coming in. The restaurant itself is small inside but has a sprawling patio with many tables and heaters spread throughout. Looking forward to going back very soon and trying more of their sliders!",4,0,0,domingo,TX
Sarah H.,2020-12-21,"Northlake, TX",5,"I was able to drop by Son of a Butcher this weekend and the sliders are top notch! Very unique choices with fresh ingredients and vibrant flavors on everything I ordered. The staff is super friendly, greeted me in the line, and even helped guide me through the ordering process. I was recommended the popper slider(YESS!).This area is super walkable with plenty of parking and they even have a way to order online and pickup without getting out of your car!! Food: Pictured are two sliders (a PB&J slider and a Jalapeño popper slider) which were both killer. The PBJ slider is juicy and filled with both sweet and savory. The popper slider had a dollop of cream cheese and jalapeños with just enough heat to enjoy. My nacho fries (perfect addition suggested by the cashier) were perfectly crispy and covered with a little bit of spice and a lot of yummy ingredients. I can't wait to go back and try other sliders on the menu! I think next up is the Philly cheesesteak or maybe the Nashville Hot... so many choices!!!",4,0,0,lunes,TX
Roger S.,2020-12-21,"Plano, TX",5,"This place is awesome! The menu is innovative and fun. You can choose a variety of sliders to try, and I suggest this method. There are just so many that sound delicious,  it will take me a few trips to get through the menu.So far, my favorite slider is the PBJ.  Wagyu beef is the base of all the topping, so you know you are about to bite in to something good. I have enjoyed several choices, such as the Juicy Lucy and the Popper.  There are also chicken options that sound really delicious, but Man, this is WAGYU,  so hard to pass up!For other reasons to go, good fries that you can dress up with toppings.  The nacho fries were great.But, now for the true story. I was not going to order a shake, but my friend got one to share. Pistachio and Mint shake,  like who freaking knew? This shake was thick and creamy with perfectly balanced flavors. I definitely had more than my share. As I write this, my taste buds are crying for another shake.They also have Craftsman type sodas.  There are some interesting flavors,  but I like my burgers with root beer. Oh, and they have wine and beer too.Oddly, my friend ordered the Richard's Rainwater, just to see. That stuff was like drinking from a artesian well! Just a side note in case you need something to chase that shake.Now for other facts, cool atmosphere,  super fun staff who really strive for you to have a great experience.  The patio is a fun place to chill and people watch while you social distance.Enjoy!",1,0,0,lunes,TX

Max P.,2020-12-26,"Benbrook, TX",5,I came in for the first time last night and was blown away. The selections for the sliders were wonderful and include chicken and veggie options.

Chrissy D.,2020-12-26,"Frisco, TX",5,Delicious sliders (small burgers) of all different flavor combinations! My personal fav is the PB&J - don't knock it til you try it!!

Rhonda T.,2020-12-27,"Rowlett, TX",3,Nice vibe. Great patio. Friendly service.  Cheese curds were good and a welcomed menu option.  All of the chicken sandwiches are dark meat.

Sandra W.,2020-12-29,"West Dallas, Dallas, TX",5,"I placed an online order for 8 different sliders, a side of nacho fries, waffle fries and the cheese curds and drove to their pickup window. The guy at the window was friendly and they had my order ready 5 minutes earlier than my specified time. No issues with the order. Their pricing is on par with most other quality burger places. Between me, my husband and my 19 y/o son, we couldn't finish all the food. Everything was good, but the stand out item for me was the Sticky Chicken, just wow. My ""don't you dare put a vegetable on my burger"" son even said he loved it and we wished we had gotten more than just one. Fries and nacho fries were good. The cheese curds were okay. I think they would have been great, but it looked like they didn't let the grease drip off enough and by the time I got home they were sitting in a pool of oil which made the breading soggy. I'll definitely be back.",0,0,0,martes,TX
Terrance W.,2020-12-29,"Dallas, TX",5,I am so happy Son of Butcher has arrived to the neighborhood.  They have put installed a pick up window and reserved spots behind the restaurant for parking. The staff was really helpful. It was my first time there and they were patient enough to explain the menu and gave me time to figure out what I was going to order. Finally the food I had was amazing. I had three different sliders and waffle fries and they all were really good.,0,0,0,martes,TX

Ash A.,2020-12-31,"CA, CA",4,"To start 2021 right, we had to sincerely say adios to 2020...SOB...here is a challenge for all of u to find a more appropriate namesake for 2020!This is a slider joint with fairly limited but well curated menu options. U can order 1, 2 or 3 sliders with fries and shakes. Wify & I ordered 3 each, I ate five...In a word: worthyWify ordered:1. The popper: liked it, little sweet but nice creamy popper kick2. TX Philly: loved it! Major kick & loads of flavor 3. Sticky Chick: too sweet, passed it to me after a bite  :) :) :) I liked it since I don't mind the sweetness4. Crispy waffle fries: decent - crispy & fresh but a bit oily Mi order:1. The popper: good but little cheesy...glad I tried it, however will try others on the menu next time2. Burnt Ends: loved it...very good. Just the right balance of meat for the slider and very juicy3. Nashville Hot: average, was expecting Lucky's hot chicken heat...this was much tamer. Again will chk out other menu items4. Buffalo blue fries: didn't care much for the combination...not for my palate, others may enjoy 5. Swanky Blueberry Cobbler Shake: it was a slippery slope - first few sips 'Great!!' and after that it got too sweet & 'Suck'ed...for reference check out Seinfeld's 'Sucks & Great' on YouTube Overall..this little place gave us 2020 closure. Just for that & service it's 5 stars...Food is 3.5 stars#RepeatRestaurant #globetrotterash",11,2,11,jueves,CA
Amanda J.,2021-01-02,"Murphy, TX",5,"I have nothing but praise for the restaurant. Immediately walking in, the staff were so kind and welcoming. They made sure we had everything we wanted and always checked in on us to make sure our dining experience was good. It was! I'm so excited to see their murals soon when they're completed! I got the 3-Slider meal with Fried Chicken, Nashville Hot Chicken, and Burnt Ends. All had such good flavor and were so unique! I also ordered a Blueberry Cobbler Shake which was my absolute favorite! It taste just like a big ol' slice of cobber with ice cream ontop. Absolutely incredible. I wanna come back and try their cheese curds! I didn't get to it this time but they look amazing. I also wanna try all the other flavors of sliders they have! They're all so unique and innovative. I just wanna stuff my face with sliders.",0,0,0,sábado,TX

patricia c.,2021-01-14,"Northlake, TX",5,"Amazing find! Food was so delicious and lots of great choices for sliders! My favorite was the jalapeño popper one, hands down the best slider I've ever had. We went this past weekend and it was absolutely freezing outside, but they have portable outdoor heaters which were a real treat to be able to enjoy your food outside on their picnic tables. The inside tables were separated and only very other table was able to be used, the registers have the clear shield & also all employees were wearing masks PROPERLY!!!! A HUGE plus, thank you so much for that!!!! The line to order was pretty long and stayed that way the entire time we were there but the wait wasn't long as they were moving pretty quickly. The only down side was when we were at the counter ordering the poor girl wasn't able to hear us because of all the noise around and we had to repeat to her a few times but she got everything correct on the order, the person behind us saw our interaction and I noticed they wrote down their order on their phone and just showed her, so smart! Overall the food was delicious and the staff was very friendly, even came outside walking around all the tables to see how all the food was and if anyone needed anything.

Caroline C.,2021-01-22,"Dallas, TX",4,"My husband and I tried Son of a Butcher out last week for lunch during the week.  Parking was easy, the staff was friendly, and the Covid protocols seemed to be pretty good.  Parking is likely to be a pain on the weekends or at night. The menu has some options that sound really interesting so we tried 6 different sliders and an order of cheese curds.  The cheese curds were good but didn't squeak like a true cheese curd should. The sliders were good, but a few of them weren't quite as flavorful as the descriptions.  The prices were a little high relative to size and quality. There could possibly be more of the ingredients listed included in each slider.  The indoor and outdoor seating is all great and we loved the location.

Brittany M.,2021-01-27,"Dallas, TX",5,Okay YUM!!!!!! Let's start with the cookie butter milkshake which might be my favorite milkshake EVER. Seriously so so good. It's hard to pick my favorite slider. The Nashville hot chicken with pimento cheese was fab but i asked for ranch to cool it down a bit. The spicy cheese curds are a MUST!! We also tried the gonzo and the popper. There's plenty of seating outside and their patio has heaters too.,0,0,1,miércoles,TX

Shelley D.,2021-01-30,"Albuquerque, NM",2,"Coming from the creators of Velvet Taco, we expected bombastic flavors wrapped in tiny packages. Maybe it our expectations were too high, but the sliders were bland. We had the Nashville and Classic. The buns are dinner rolls and ours were untoasted-- they were also not fully separated and still connected on the back end, meaning the flavors all dripped out the front and the last bite was just bread. Lack of seasoning and condiments on the Classic meant we were left with a semi-warm patty on dry bread. Not a fan-- don't think we'll come try it out again unless with friends. Why would we when the #3 tikka masala at Velvet Taco is only on street away?",1,0,0,sábado,NM

Hannah M.,2021-02-06,"Fort Worth, TX",2,"I heard great things about this new pop up in lower greenville and the restaurant was PACKED when we arrived. So we had high hopes! It was definitely overpriced for how tiny their sliders are. I'm not a big eater and I could probably eat 4-5. One of my orders (the Buffalo chicken) had great flavor on the sweet bun, but the chicken was terrible. It was not high quality white meat at all. I couldn't even swallow it after I took my first bite and looked at what I was eating. The only thing I gave this place two stars for was the milk shake! Cookie butter was a delicious after meal treat. A little disappointed and probably won't be returning.",0,0,0,sábado,TX
Charlie D.,2021-02-06,"Arlington, TX",5,"Second round of SOB and first time trying a swanky shake! It was most definitely a strong drink! I will be coming back to try a non alcoholic shake next time though because it looks like it would taste amazing. I can't get over their bbq sauce and of course the main course sliders! I got the pb&j , the popper and, sticky chicken. The popper was delicious and most definitely packs a kick. Pb&j was most definitely filled with a good amount of pb&j flowing out the sides of the slider as you take a bite! Yum!!!! The sticky chicken did have Thai flavors with another Asian flavor that I couldn't pin point! Very interesting but I probably won't be coming back for that ... most definitely select any of their other chicken sliders and be prepared for a flavor packed rollercoaster!!! Amazing customer service with a filling meal always a solid A+ in my book! Good luck with your new location and keep up the solid work!",0,0,0,sábado,TX

The staff went out of their way to try to ensure the heat lamps were working and available for their patrons sitting outside on a cold winter's night.  The outside is super cute with the benches and super spacious.   They made some recommendations for our meals and were sure to check on how we liked their suggestions.  When a friend asked for jalapeños, he literally went and chopped some up totally fresh!  I haven't experienced such genuine and kind hearted service in a while and it definitely pays.Ok but on to the food- yum! I love the fried chicken and the classic wagyu.  The sliders are just the right size where you don't feel too guilty about eating too many but you also need about three to get full.  The baked cheese curds and the boozy blueberry cobbler rounded out my satisfying meal.  Yes- a boozy shake in an unexpectedly delicious flavor. Go try something new and live a little!  The price point is just right and 3 for $11.25 is solid. Will definitely be back.",15,8,20,viernes,TX

We're not fans of bleu cheese so we also ordered 2 sides of ranch and added it to our Buffalo Fried Chicken sliders. Everything was delicious! Our favorites were the Nashville Hot Chicken, Buffalo Fried Chicken, the Pork Meatball and the Spicy Cheese Curds. The Nashville Hot Chicken was delicious and had a great amount of heat to it.

The best one was the meatball to ME, my boyfriend really enjoyed the burnt end burger w/ the caramelized onions. SO GOOD. We always got the loaded nacho fries, and woooooo those were just as amazing. I did get a boozy shake, but I personally wasn't a fan, it was super sweet and grainy. BUT, if you like super sweet and vanilla vodka, this is up your alley.

The restaurant is clean and the staff was friendly. My experience was good. Let's talk about the food and drinks. TX Philly was my favorite. This slider was full of flavor. It packed a powerful punch in a few tiny bites. The caramelized onions were delicious. Yummy!Classic Slider gets an honorable mention. Nice flavor, but I needed some onions. The pickles and cheese and SOB sauce worked well. Waffle Fries were cooked perfectly. The perfect amount for watching my waistline. Lemonade was tart and not to sweet. I liked it, but others may wish it was sweeter. Cookie Butter Milkshake was PERFECT! I added the booze. OMG it was strong, but so freaking good. I definitely will go back for another shake. I left happy and full. This place exceeded my expectations. The name is cute and catchy. I look forward to trying the other location.I had to take a star off.

Zarina S.,2021-03-13,"Cleveland, OH",5,"WOW is all there really is to say! Was looking forward to trying this new spot on my monthly trip in town to Dallas and it did not disappoint! Ambience- located in the heart of lower Greenville, this is a casual burger joint with an indoor dining option and a larger outdoor patio with benches and portable heaters. It is perfect for a quick bite on the go (drive-thru available), lunch with your buddies, or a late night food option. Service- amazing service staff- everyone is friendly, welcoming, and looks happy to be working there. They wear masks, and there is someone cleaning the tables and wiping down surfaces frequently. Food- by far the best sliders I've ever had! They have both chicken and wagyu beef options, and you can order 1, 2, or 3 in an order (roughly $3 each). I had the Texas slider which was packed with flavors of carmelized onion, Fresno chili, cheese and cilantro- AMAZING. My husband had the burnt ends slider which he enjoyed as well. The waffle fries are perfectly crisped, finished with a side of spicy cheese. Overall phenomenal food quality and flavor. Will definitely be coming back for more, can't wait to try their boozy shakes next time!!",0,0,0,sábado,OH

I loved the Burnt Ends slider and the ""sticky chick"".  I would say 2-3 sliders would be the equivalent of one regular sized burger.  The meat is clearly high quality, and they do a really good job of getting just the right cook.  The outdoor area is large and there are plenty of picnic tables.  It's dog friendly, which is great, and it's in a very trendy area.    My only complaint would be related to parking....although there is a parking area, this area can get VERY busy.

The popper had pepper jelly which I thoroughly enjoyed (probably my favorite)! The Tx philly was okay to me nothing too special. The burnt ends however was perfect for any bbq lover.

We were really excited to try SOB and it smelled amazing, but the sliders were just -- dry and I thought fairly tasteless if it weren't for some of the add-ons. I got a fried chicken slider and a beef slider. The chicken was pretty tough and pretty flavorless and definitely needed more gravy/sauce. The beef slider (the popper) was better only because of the Jalapeño jelly and cream cheese --the meat on its own lacked any flavor. My husband commented that McDonald's has more flavorful burgers.

Rachel M.,2021-04-09,"Fort Worth, TX",2,"Here are my problems with my visit today1.  I don't like the tip jar at the register. Why are you asking for tips before you even take my order? You order at the register and then you pick up your food when they call your name. What's the tip for? I think this is how employers get out of paying fair wages. 2. Portions are small for the amount they charge. 2 slides are $7.503. I asked for no bun - I got buns. We asked for no jalapeños- we got jalapeños. I asked for extra crisp cheese curd - they were cold and not extra crispy. I think we ended up with food that had already been made and was sitting partially under a warmer.4.

I decided to shake it off since I know being in the food industry can be sometimes stressful so I tried to be as polite as I could but as I was asking her a couple questions about the menu since it was my first time there.. she would respond to me in a really mad aggressive way I felt really rushed she would make annoyed gestures as I was ordering I just did not feel welcomed at all.

Jonathan L.,2021-06-06,"Dallas, TX",1,"I think this place is best appreciated by individuals who have a phobia about meat juice because you will find no juicy sliders here, I almost thought it was a vegan patty at first bite! When I saw the lines outside the building I was excited and came with high hopes. I ordered box of assorted sliders and paid $50 for a hamburger experience that left me sadly disappointed. Aesthetically, it is a super hip indoor/outdoor experience and the sliders themselves have quite a bit of novelty in their construction, however, I'm not here for the ambience or the vibe. I am looking for a great burger and there were none to be found here. All sliders rely on their foundation of a great patty or cutlet; regardless of what other accoutrement adorn this quick bite, it all comes down to this foundation. Every piece of meat in the variety pack was waaay overcooked--from the bone dry, rockhard beef pucks to the flavorless fried chicken cutlets; even the overcooked sweetly sauced burnt ends were tough and dry (a triple no no for Texas BBQ). Salt-in-the-wound--which would have been better reserved for the meat--the strange sauces, topping quality, and fast drying Hawaiian rolls did nothing to help the final product slide home. I can only assume this place appeals to the hip professional who does not know how to cook for themselves or has never had a great burger prepared for them.

Ariel T.,2021-07-18,"Carrollton, TX",3,"Ordered from Uber Eats:Cheese Fries 10/10 - At first glance they looked disappointing, but at first bite I was proven wrong.Nashville Hot Chicken 4.5/10 - The chicken itself had a strange taste & wasn't very good unfortunately. However the sauce that they have on it is awesome! So the side of the sandwich that had the sauce on it tasted okay. I definitely WILL NOT get this one again. I love spicy chicken sandwiches too :/Classic Wagyu 10/10 - Chefs kiss! Such a Devine little burger! They don't allow for add-one (Uber eats) but I didn't need any. The way it comes prepared with their sauce, cheese & I think onions(?) was perfect. The meat tasted great and all the flavors worked well together. I actually ate this one first so I thought the others would be at the top with this little guy. They did not.Burnt Ends Wagyu 4/10 - I wanted to like this one so bad, people have had so many good things to say about this one in particular, but alas, I can only tell my truth. This one was worse than the chicken sandwich. It had a very off taste. I feel like it should've worked but mine tasted so so OFF. Price 6/10 - Honestly the price would have been justified if at least one more of the sliders had tasted a little better .Overall I would try the other flavors, I feel that it would be worth giving it another shot now that I know what not to get lol because when it's good, ITS VERY GOOD!",1,0,1,domingo,TX

Jay S.,2021-08-02,"Dallas, TX",5,"Exactly what I was hoping for!Slider-sized (but honestly still bigger than anything you can get at a fast food joint) and priced at $4/each you really can't go wrong with their interesting assortment of burger and chicken sandwiches. I considered getting the chicken but then was like NAHHHHH, there are hot chicken places everywhere these days. So I decided to go with the burgers. And I'm glad I did. I rolled the dice and ordered up the Burnt Ends (smoked brisket, Gouda cheese, BBQ sauce, caramelized onion and chipotle mayo) and the PB&J (blackberry jam, bacon, crunchy peanut butter, American cheese, caramelized onion). The PB&J was the big winner -- it was sensationally overwhelming to my tastebuds -- if you're a PB&J fan, don't be afraid to flex your palette muscles on this one!The Burnt Ends was also very good -- I probably should've eaten this first as the brisket quickly cooled while I devoured the PB&J but the caramelized onions and BBQ sauce flow perfectly atop the burger and brisket. I didn't order anything else but will add that there's plenty of water bowls available for your furry friend on the patio so bonus points for thinking of our jealous companions!One final note...I've been back here a few times since I posted this and recently I ordered a burger (that shall remain nameless) that my wife wasn't thrilled with.

However, the sauce did not detract from a perfectly cooked juicy burger with cheese, pickle, and sauce. The highlight was that fried chicken slider. That one slider is more than enough if you're doing a side of fries. The chicken had the perfectly crispy outside and an crazy juicy center. It was great! As far as value. I spent $15 plus on 2 sliders, fries, and a drink. I thought it was high for what I ordered until I got it. One slider, fries, and a drink would have been more than enough.

Small portions but the seasoning is amazing.The cashier was very sweet & attentive. She was a thin lady with glasses, and very hard working.

Sliders also very small,0,0,0,lunes,TX
Dolores D.,2021-11-25,"Phoenix, AZ",4,Good sliders. They are meaty lol. I got the the frozen margarita it does have alcohol in it.

Perry P.,2021-12-12,"Rosemead, CA",4,"If you are looking for Texas BBQ but you don't want to get your hands too dirty, look no further than Son of a Butcher where you can get BBQ on a slider. While exploring Dallas on a work trip, my friends and I stumbled across this establishment, and we were intrigued. Getting close to the door we liked how the restaurant was very ""butcher themed"" but in a fun way. Door handles were cleavers, and the drive through had shadows of images painted on the wall. It's family and pet friendly which is also a nice addition, and they even have a doghouse with the name Doggo of the Butcher painted on top of it. Parking was plentiful with their own private lot behind the restaurant and if that fills up, there seems to be lots of street parking as well.The menu was easy to understand with 10 different meat selections and 1 veggie. Remember these are not full-sized burgers but sliders so it's recommended to order a few just so you can taste a few. Drinks consist of soda, sweet tea, and milkshakes with sides consisting of a variety of fries and onion rings. Ordering was easy and is similar to fast food restaurants where you order at the counter and they call your name to pick up your food. I ordered the Classic and The Burnt Ends sliders with Nacho Fries and the classy shake. FYI you can also make the shake boozy but since it was early in the day, I opted out of it.Within five minutes of ordering I had my food and my shake. Since the day was nice my friends and I decided to sit outside. The tables were clean and had umbrellas just in case it gets too hot or it starts raining. The sliders were moist with soft bread and perfectly cooked meats; however the star of the show is the shake. With just the right amount of sweetness the shake was refreshing but not too overbearing. If you're ever looking for a place to hang out and catch up with friends while chowing down on sliders and shakes, Son of a Butcher is the place to go.",1,0,2,domingo,CA

It's one of my favorite places on Greenville. Today, the sliders were awesome per usual however, the cheese curds were disappointing. I was surprised to get substantially less of them. Per a staff member, the portion of cheese curds have changed but remain the same price. I would not mind paying more for the old portion, as they are worth it.

He got the original and I got one original and one brisket. I ordered the waffle fries which were seasoned to perfection. He got the onion rings which are more like an onion ring/onion straw hybrid. Also, very good. Not too much breading. You order inside which my husband did so I didn't see what the inside looked like, but the service was fast. They have quite a few different options of sliders to choose from and even have milkshakes. I was shocked at the huge size of the slider. I was only able to eat one of mine, so I opted for the brisket one. It was delicious. A burger topped with burnt ends and Gouda cheese. My husband is a traditionalist so he loved the originals.

We had a common mix up on the name that was one letter off and she spoke to my brother in law like he was in the wrong. As soon as I spoke up that we did not hear the name correctly and it was a mistake she was aggressively rude and caused a scene in front of the customers. I am not one to get angry but I was furious that this was happening in such a manor. She continued to argue with me as I walked out the door and I felt extremely uncomfortable.

John W.,2022-09-13,"Dallas, TX",5,"Came here during my lunch break and am glad I made the visit. The restaurant is located in the lower Greenville area, which can get pretty crazy depending on the time; however, I came during the day when things were more laid back. The ambience was incredible, especially for a burger joint. The staff was cordial and took my order the second I walked in the door. I got the wagyu slider during my first visit, which whether it was real wagyu or not, tasted incredible. The quality was definitely there, and if I could go back in time, I may have gotten three as they have great deals for their sliders as well. They also sell chicken sliders that look just as good and may have to get the next time I go. The fries were good, but a little too crispy in my opinion. My favorite part, though, was the strawberry lemonade. They serve it in a huge cup, and I made sure to finish every bit of it as it really was that good in my opinion.Overall, I definitely recommend this place, especially if you live or plan on visiting the lower Greenville area!",4,2,4,martes,TX

I believe its 3 sliders for 12.50. and out of the three, i really enjoyed the comeback and pb&j. Don't get me wrong, the brunt ends were also very good.  The pb&j works really well with the wagyu patty. They also have an veggie option as well (made with black bean)As for the waffle fries, i wish they had more queso on top of it. Felt like they kinda skimped on it. They also have plenty of seats inside as well as outdoor seating.When i come back to this area, i'll definitely come back here.",6,2,4,domingo,TX

Rebecca H.,2022-11-19,"Dallas, TX",5,"First time coming to Son of a Butcher. I had heard great things about this place. The patty was cooked perfectly with a crispy bun on each slider. I was amazed with how flavorful each slider was. Not one was overcooked or undercooked. They were all cooked to perfection. Now when i'm craving a burger, I know that this place is where it's at. I like that it's not a big burger, so I can get multiple sliders with different craveable flavors. When I looked at the menu, I had a hard time deciding between what I wanted. There are so many solid options that I know I would love. The combinations of flavors make my mouth water just thinking about taking that juicy bite of pure burger bliss. My boyfriend and I ended up getting four sliders. The Irishman, Gobbler, Buffalo, and All American. We both had a favorite which was the Gobbler. It's the Butcher's Special, and tasted just like Thanksgiving on a burger. It was sooo good. I would get that again and again. All the other burgers were really good too. The Irishman was my second favorite. I would get it again. I liked the cheese and sauce on it. The All American was super delicious. It's a very big bite, and I was happy for that. Loved all the gooey, melty cheese. The Buffalo burger was good, but I probably could do without it next time. It would be great for someone who really loves buffalo sauce. I would definitely recommend this place! Very cool vibes inside and outside. Can't wait to come back and try different sliders :)",1,0,0,sábado,TX

My order didnt take long (5 minutes) and the staff seemed competent in making my order. I ordered the Irishman and the Comeback slider, just so I could try both beef and chicken options. Both had no flavor. I could tell there was salt and a savory aspect from the meats, and that was it. The further I got through my meal, the slower I ate, ensuring I had not savored the meal long enough. every bite was bland and underwhelming. I felt like I had anosmia as the texture was the only thing I could definitely feel. Surely based on the advertising of wagyu cooked at medium rare, maldon sea salt, and specific bread would have been the calling card for quality. Alas, this is another trendy establishment that looks better on paper than execution. For anyone who's diet consist of frozen pizzas and microwavable chicken nuggets, this will be a fun night on the town for you! If you are trying to sober up and need to choke down some bread and protein, then I guess this place is better than getting a DUI to try to go somewhere else better.",1,2,1,domingo,TX

I am very glad that I did.As per our last visit, the service was spot on! Friendly and efficient. We order the Hot Honey Chicken, Irishman Wagyu, The Popper, Onion Rings, and Nacho Fries. All of which were hot and ready in a matter of minutes!The Hot Honey Chicken was FIRE!!! Crispy Chicken tossed in a WELL executed Hot Honey Sauce, was all things Crunchy, Sweet, Spicy, and Sticky!(Ya'll, erbody does not do Hot Honey well, let me just tell you that NOW!) Pickled Red Onions and Gouda Cheese. Plus! (I did not know this on my previous visit) They offer the cutest(and tasty) GLUTEN-FREE SLIDER BUN!!! Irishman was Wagyu Beef(naturally) White Irish Cheddar, Stout Aioli, Caramelized Onions and a Parsley Salad. It was a good seasoned slider, but I was looking for that earthy, malt Stout flavor that would have really made this a standout slider. Caramelizing the onions in the Stout would have been a great way to marry the sweet flavors of the onions with the Stout Beer. Or, reducing down the beer into a syrup and then adding it to the Aioli, would have been another option. The Popper is a slider version of a jalapeno popper! Nicely seasoned Wagyu Beef topped with Fried Jalapeno Cream Cheese, Pepper Jam and Rosemary Aioli, with Bacon and Cilantro(Yes, honey I know it's a lot, but it all worked!) This was my husbands FAVORITE!Onion Rings, SAY LESS! Always a winner and consistent! Thick rings on Sweet Onions and a perfectly crisp exterior. Now, The NACHOOOOO FRIES! They were AWESOME!!! Waffle Fries smothered in Queso, Ranch, Queso Fresco, and Cilantro. I LOVE NACHOS and this was a great representation! Gooey, bursting with flavor!

They are filling for me at least. Definitely a place to grab food if you live the smoke life. If you are a diabetic be mindful of the shakes and treats.

The popper slider I won't be repeating, I was hoping the jalapeño popper would have a crunch to it, but it just blended in to everything that was there, a crunch would've definitely added more to the texture of the slider. This burger also has a slight sweetness that I would exchanged for spiciness (it is a stuffed jalapeño after all). The classic  slider was great and the pickle gave it that much needed crunch.

Sam F.,2023-10-31,"Lake Worth, FL",5,Surprisingly really good! Didn't expect that. Cool. atmosphere too. Burgers are cooked perfectly with that red rare  juicy bloody meat that animal activist protest against eating. The lady that was at the cashier was super friendly and helpful. Get the cookie butter shake if you want to live forever.,0,0,1,martes,FL
Jingwen Z.,2023-11-07,"Dallas, TX",4,"This is a casual spot to grab some delicious creative sliders. The size of each slider is decent, and I was full after 2 - you can also opt to order 3 (or more), making this a good option for a party where multiple people eat different amounts. I got the Cowboy and the Burnt Ends, both of which were delicious. I'd skip the nacho fries, though, as the fries became soggy rather quickly and the meat is very salty (and ground). Overall a good pick and I would love to come back!",1,0,1,martes,TX
Jessica V.,2023-11-09,"Dallas, TX",1,"This was my first time ! The young lady that took my order was very friendly and explained the menu as we mentioned it was our first time. We received our food, we got the 3 sliders one Nashville one classic and one ranger and some waffle fries! The buns were cold the classic tasted like a McDonald's kids meal burger which for my daughter was perfect! The ranger was for me maybe it should have said light one the sauce since it was cold it just made the meat cold same for the Nashville I think kfc Nashville chicken sandwich is better. My fries were supper hard and cold ! I was surprised seeing that they were busy and people kept coming in.",0,0,0,jueves,TX
Kai S.,2023-11-16,"Baltimore, MD",3,"I don't eat beef! My brother said the burgers are amazing though. The chicken sandwiches are basically a chicken tender on a bun. The fries aren't well seasoned and the queso is very thick. I was not a fan of the onion rings, they had no taste.",0,0,0,jueves,MD
Melinda A.,2023-11-24,"Cypress, TX",5,First time ever and it did not disappoint. Loved my two sliders. The Cowboy had a nice bit of heat with pimento. So yummy. The service was great. So much food that I did not eat my second slider the Jalapeño popper. Late night snack. The ambiance was nice. Enjoyed seeing the patrons with their dogs outside. There are silver water dishes for the dogs. Loved it.,0,0,0,viernes,TX

Jazmine H.,2023-12-10,"Dallas, TX",4,"SOLID! I enjoyed this visit to SOB. I went Sunday evening so there wasn't a crowd at all. Plenty of seating inside and outside and they even have a pick up window outside. I ordered 3 sliders -- Classic, All American, Prime Rib, waffles fries and a shake. All really good but I loved the Classic more than the others. The fries were fresh and tasty. The shake was soooo good, we got the cookie butter. I will definitely be back to try more.",1,0,0,domingo,TX
Rachel A.,2023-12-14,"San Francisco, CA",5,I absolutely love this place!! 3/$15 sliders is a good meal! Service is always friendly and fast! The outside patio area is so cute well put together for a Greenville restaurant! We continue to go back!,0,0,0,jueves,CA
Shawneedawn B.,2023-12-21,"Woodson Village - Pershing, College Station, TX",5,Slides are unbeatable. Quick and amazing. They have the perfect amount of sauce and additions that they don't overwhelm the burger patty. Tikka and popper sliders are my all time favorite!,0,0,0,jueves,TX
Lisa W.,2023-12-31,"Pasadena, TX",4,"Counter service, not a long wait, tho we were there 10 minutes after opening.  Reasonably priced for what you get.  Ordered the classic, pbj and Nashville hot.  All were good and well prepared.  Also had the half and half (rings and tots).  Onion rings were very good!  Would get an order of them alone.  Lots of specialty milkshakes and brews, but we did not try any.  Would go back for sure!",0,0,0,domingo,TX
Jesus V.,2024-01-05,"Willis, TX",1,Terrible service had an attitude from the start when ordering .Ik it's a slider place but you didn't have to give me a half a$$ service with cold fries .first time & last time ever coming to this place .Don't waste your money on some over hype place.NOT Worth it.,0,0,0,viernes,TX
